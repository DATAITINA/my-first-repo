Welcome to my AI Engineering Journey — a public, evolving record of my path toward becoming a world-class AI/ML Engineer.

This repository documents what I’m learning, building, breaking, and mastering across mathematics, machine learning, systems, and real-world AI engineering.

This is not a tutorial repo.
It’s a growth log + engineering lab + long-term vision.
